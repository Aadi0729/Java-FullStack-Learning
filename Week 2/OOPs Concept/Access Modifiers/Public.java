public :

1) A class can be public
2) accessible everywhere
3) If the class is public then the name of the source code file should be same as the classname

Ex:
MyClass.java
public class MyClass {
  
}

In a source code file, we can have only one public class
Ex: 
A.java (error)
public class A {)
public class B {)
